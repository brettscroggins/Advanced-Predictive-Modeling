Your class should take as input the learning_rate, regularization_constant and number of epochs. The fit method must take as input X,y and a choice of update_rule as 'SGD' or 'adagrad' (Notes on implementation below). The _predict_ method takes an X value (optionally, an array of values). Use your new gradient descent regression to predict the data given in 'samples.csv', for 10 epochs, using learning rates: [.0001, .001, .01, 0.1, 1, 10, 100] and regularization constants in the range: [0,10,100] . Plot MSE and the $w$ parameters as a function of epoch count (10 epochs) for the best 2 combinations of learning_rate and regularization for both SGD and Adagrad. ie you should have 2 plots of MSE and parameter updates for SGD and adagrad each. Report the MSE at the end of 10 epochs for all 4 combinations.\n",

The pitfall of using SGD is that in certain situations, momentum may be very high and does not know to slow down - thus we do not accurately achieve the desired minima. AdaGrad, on the other hand, allows the learning rate to adapt, essentially eliminating a need to tune the learning rate. With this in mind, the initial setting is insignificant since AdaGrad should theoretically tune to the optimal parameters.  \n",

    "In comparing these four screenshots and scenarios, we are able to see that Tanh returns the lowest test and train losses, followed by ReLU, Sigmoid, and Linear. Some items to note were that ReLU also showed a strong accuracy in the separating the blues and oranges. Sigmoid had a quick drop when running the epochs that resulted in a sharp decline in losses and clearly defined clusters of blues and oranges. Tanh had a steady decline in losses throughout the number of epochs. Linear resulted in a quick drop in losses and then no change through most of the latter epochs.\n",
    "<br>\n",

    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "In both cases presented above, we chose to use the maximum number of neurons for each layer. In Sub-Part ii) of the earlier Part A, we were able to see that a higher number of neurons resulted in a lower test and training loss. Furthermore, the ReLU activation function seemed to be more accurate in classifying blues and oranges. Additional parameters were not modified, such as learning rate, set to the standard value of 0.03 for computational time benefits. With no noise, there would not be a huge perceived benefit in adding many additional hidden layers, so 3 and 2 hidden layers were chosen, respectively.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Numerically, we see that using 7 inputs produces a lower test and train loss as compared to 2 inputs. With the additional inputs, we would expect a higher classification accuracy. It is notable that both test losses are around 0.03 and training losses around 0.004 - therefore we can see that the model is slightly overfitted. However, the losses have still been fairly minimized without overthinking the problem, and by using the concepts described earlier, these were the optimal results given what we know about each individual tuning parameter."

    "Here, we see that with the models tuned for various learning rates, the lowest RMSE is returned with the lowest learning rate of 0.005. It is also interesting to note that the RMSE shoots up when we set learning rate = 1. With a higher learning rate, we are less likely to converge - the RMSE in this case likely moved outside of any bounds (ie: minima) to return this extremely high result."

    "( 2 points )\n",
    "\n",
    "b. Suppose you want to learn a binary classifier to predict whether or not a customer will buy a TV. The class label is 0 if the customer does not buy a TV and 1 if they do. For each customer, you are given two features, $x_1$ is the per hour salary and $x_2$ is the age. Assume that the class conditional distribution $p([x_1 , x_2]|C)$ is Gaussian. The mean salary and age of the people who do buy a TV is 15 and 30 respectively and that of those who don’t is 8.5 and 25. Assume that both classes of customers have the same covariance given by the Identity matrix. Further, your sales data suggests that only 1 in 3 people actually bought a TV in the last few years. Mathematically derive the (optimal) Bayes decision boundary for this problem. (5 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "c. Now write code to sample 100 customers from each class (C = 0, 1) under the assumed distribution and the estimated parameters and plot their features. Additionally, plot the decision boundary you obtained in the part (b) on the same plot. (3 points)\n",

    "In this problem, you will model the data using decision trees to perform a classification task. Load the BreastTissue.csv dataset. The dataset has been preprocessed. The description of the dataset can be found [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Tissue). Using the class tree.DecisionTreeClassifier (http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#module-sklearn.tree), build two different trees with a maximum depth of two using the split criteria (i) Gini and (ii) Entropy. Use all the data to build trees. Plot the two trees. If your classifier object is called clf, use the following commands to save the generated tree as a '.dot' file that can be used to visualize the tree using Webgraphviz: http://www.webgraphviz.com/\n",

On the \"False\" branch, we see that `class = mas` is now present for the Entropy plot as well as `class = aid`."
